Tidepool mobile app using React Native


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). And then ejected to React Native, from Expo. Currently the bulk of the source is in the expo folder. The app is also ejected to React Native. The intention is that we can support Expo variant of the app, with storybook support, for more productive development, and have the ejected version side-by-side, to support building production app. See the respective READMEs in the expo and ejected folders for more info.
