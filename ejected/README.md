This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). And then ejected to React Native, from Expo.

## Scripts

### `yarn run pre`

This must be used once before trying to run the packager (e.g. from Xcode or Android Studio). This copies the Expo src, assets, and other folders and files into place for use by the ejected app. TODO: This copying is not ideal. We should investigate CRNA and RN packager support for multiple roots and ideally share these files and folders before the Expo and ejected versions of the apps without need for copying!
